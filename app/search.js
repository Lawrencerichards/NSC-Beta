This abnormal shape causes the cells to clump together making their passage through smaller blood vessels difficult, which may lead to blockage of these small blood vessels and an associated inflammatory reaction.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/pregnancy-and-baby/Pages/screening-sickle-cell-thalassaemia-pregnant.aspx" target="_blank">&raquo; Read more about sickle cell and thalassaemia on NHS Choices</a></p>',

Hypothyroidism can occur in newborn infants (Congenital Hypothyroidism, CHT) as well as later on in childhood (acquired Hypothyroidism, AHT). Affected newborns look, and usually act, normal for the first few days and the national screening programme for CHT, by blood spot collection, ensures that affected infants are identified and treated as early as possible. The commonest cause of CHT is a poorly developed or absent thyroid gland; the underlying basis to this abnormality is only clear in a small proportion of cases. CHT can also occur if there is a defect in thyroxine production within the gland. These defects may be permanent or transient. Although every child with CHT should be started on thyroxine promptly, they should be evaluated at some time later to exclude a transient problem. Children with CHT do very well as adults in the long-term, as long as they receive adequate thyroxine replacement.</p>',

Sometimes, although the ball is in the socket it can slip in and out of place. This is what is meant by the hip being dislocatable. Sometimes although the hip is in the socket it is not deeply in place and we call this hip \'subluxated.\' Finally in some children although the hip is in the right place the socket does not grow properly and is too shallow. If the hip socket is shallow this may allow the ball to move from the position it should occupy.</p>\r\n<p>1 to 2 in 1,000 babies born may have a hip that is dislocated at birth. A slightly larger group of children have hips which are not safely in the socket or in whom the socket is shallower than it should be. In general girls are more likely to be affected than boys.

The most common reason for PCHI is loss of hair cells in the inner ear but it is sometimes due to malformation of the middle ear ossicles (small bones that transmit vibrations of the ear drum) or the ear canal (tube from the outer to the inner ear). If the hearing loss is due to a problem within the inner ear (sensory), or occasionally due to abnormalities in the hearing nerve (neural), the term sensorineural hearing loss is used. Hearing loss due to a problem within the middle ear or the outer ear is called a conductive hearing loss while a combination of sensorineural and conductive hearing loss is called a mixed loss.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Hearing-and-vision-tests-for-children/Pages/Introduction.aspx">&raquo; Read more about hearing and deafness on NHS Choices</a></p>',

Once infection has taken place, the virus remains dormant within the body, usually with no ill effects. However, recurrences of the virus in body fluids may occur at intervals.</p>\r\n<p>In the UK about forty per cent of women are susceptible to CMV at the time of pregnancy. The main risk is when women catch the viral infection for the first time in pregnancy. Women are usually only mildly unwell with a sore throat and flu-like illness. The chance of the baby becoming infected is about forty per cent. Over ninety per cent of infected babies have no signs of anything wrong at birth.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Cytomegalovirus/Pages/Introduction.aspx">&raquo; Read more about cytomegalovirus on&nbsp;NHS Choices</a></p>',

This situation is called carrying GBS or being colonised with GBS.&nbsp;GBS is commonly found in the digestive system and the female reproductive system. It\'s estimated that about one in four pregnant women in the UK carry GBS.</p>\r\n<p>Around the time of labour and birth, many babies come into contact with GBS and are colonised by the bacteria.&nbsp;Most pregnant women who carry GBS bacteria have healthy babies. However, there\'s a small risk that GBS can pass to the baby during childbirth. Rarely, GBS infection in newborn babies can cause serious complications that can be life-threatening.</p>\r\n<p>Extremely rarely, GBS infection during pregnancy can also cause miscarriage, early (premature) labour or stillbirth.&nbsp;If a baby develops GBS infection less than seven days after birth, it\'s known as early-onset GBS infection. Most babies who become infected develop symptoms within 12 hours of birth.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s estimated that about one in 2,000 babies born in the UK and Ireland develops early-onset GBS infection. This means that every year in the UK (with 680,000 births a year) around 340 babies will develop early-onset GBS infection.</p>\r\n<p>There are a number of clinical risk factors which increase the risk of EOGBS sepsis. These include preterm birth (less than 37 weeks gestation), prolonged rupture of the membranes&nbsp;and maternal fever in labour.

    'Description': '<p>Edwards\' Syndrome (Trisomy 18) and Patau&rsquo;s syndrome (Trisomy 13) are rare but very serious conditions which affect a small number of babies every year. They are caused (like Down&rsquo;s syndrome) by the baby having an incorrect number of chromosomes in every cell. Chromosomes are structures that carry important information that determine how we develop.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Most babies will sadly die before they are born or shortly after birth. Some babies may survive to adulthood but this is rare. Many of these babies will unfortunately be stillborn. If they survive it is difficult to say how serious the effects will be before the baby is born. However, all babies born with Edward&rsquo;s Syndrome and Patau&rsquo;s Syndrome will have a wide range of problems, which are usually extremely serious. These may include major brain abnormalities, heart problems, unusual head and facial features, growth problems, unable to stand or walk, unable to talk and problems with their kidneys.</p>\r\n<p>Although women of any age can have a child with Edwards\' or Patau&rsquo;s syndrome, the chance increases as a woman gets older.</p>\r\n<p>Edwards\' syndrome affects about 3 of every 10,000 births and Patau&rsquo;s about 2 of every 10,000 births.</p>\r\n<p>When a woman is tested for Down&rsquo;s syndrome in early pregnancy the ultrasound scan may also suggest that her baby has Edwards or Patau&rsquo;s syndrome.</p>\r\n<p>A number of <a href="policydb_download.php?doc=382">questions and answers </a>have been developed to help explain the current screening recommendations.</p>\r\n<p><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/edwards-syndrome/Pages/Introduction.aspx" target="_blank">&gt;&gt;Read more about T18 on NHS Choices</a></p>',

Babies with LCHADD become ill when their body cannot produce enough energy and develop symptoms including poor feeding, irritability, sleepiness, vomiting, breathing difficulties, floppiness and Low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia).</p>\r\n<p>Without treatment babies can develop heart problems, go into a coma and it can cause death.
